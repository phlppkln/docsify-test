[Learn more about using GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project).

You can also clone (i.e download) a copy of your repository to your computer and [run Docsify locally](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) to preview your site. See the below video for details.

Do you use GitLab? You can also use Docsify with [GitLab Pages](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy?id=gitlab-pages)!

üß© Embedding Docsify Page Content into Other Systems
---  

![ Docsify Open Course Page Embedded into the Canvas LMS](screenshot-2.jpg)
_Figure 2. Docsify Open Course Page Embedded into the Canvas LMS. Explore an example Canvas LMS course using Docsify Open Course pages for content at [https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/44038/](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/44038)_

The optional ‚Äòembedded‚Äô (all lowercase) URL parameter hides a site‚Äôs sidebar and optional navbar for seamlessly embedding Docsify page content within another platform such as Canvas LMS, Moodle, Microsoft Teams etc.

To only display Docsify page content, add the following to a Docsify page URL:

`?embedded=true`

For example, https://hibbitts-design.github.io/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/#/resources would display a standard Docsify page while https://hibbitts-design.github.io/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/#/resources?embedded=true would only display page content (i.e. no sidebar or optional navbar is shown).

To optionally hide the 'Edit this Page on GitHub' link, use the following:

`?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true`

For example, https://hibbitts-design.github.io/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/#/resources would display a standard Docsify page while https://hibbitts-design.github.io/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/#/resources?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true would only display page content (i.e. no sidebar or optional navbar is shown) and also hide the 'Edit this Page on GitHub' link.

üåê Using an LMS to Host a Docsify Open Course Site
---

As Docsify Open Course Starter Kit does not require a web server, it can actually be hosted on many LMSs that support file libraries such as Canvas and Moodle.

For example, here is a [Docsify Open Course Site hosted within a Canvas course](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/44038/files/15884796/download) and here is a [Docsify Open Course Site hosted within a Moodle course](https://paulhibbitts.net/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=25). Single Docsify Open Course site pages can also be embedded while hosted on the same system.

**Hosting a Docsify Open Course Site on your LMS**
1. Tap **Download** on your repository page
2. Upload to your LMS file storage area, and unzip the upload file
3. Based on your LMS, determine the external URL required to load the `index.html` file within the Docsify `Docs` folder. In Canvas, an example URL would look similar to `https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/44038/files/15884796/download`.

| :warning: | Once hosted within your LMS, changes made to the source GitHub repository are no longer automatically reflected on your hosted Docsify site. Any GitHub repository updates must be manually uploaded to the LMS file library area. |
